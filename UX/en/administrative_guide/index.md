## Add existing Compositeur Digital folders

By default, your universes are all stored under a single folder of your personal computer. This folder is `Documents\Compositeur Digital UX`.

Depending on your enterprise configuration, you could have an access to a shared storage system (e.g. Microsoft SharePoint, Google Drive, Dropbox, ect). You can add these folders as Compositeur Digital folders. It means that when you start Compositeur Digital UX, the system will check if there are universes in all the folders you have set.

Using a shared storage system is very convenient to share your universes with all the people who need to use Compositeur Digital UX.

To add existing Compositeur Digital folders:
