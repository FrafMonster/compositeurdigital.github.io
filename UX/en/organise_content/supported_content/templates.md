# Creating Templates

Compositeur Digital UX allows you to put templates inside your environment. A template is a document which can be instantiated as many times as needed.
Templates are useful when it comes to apply specific methods that requires a lot of documents (e.g. "Speedboat" method). They allow you not to have too many documents inside your universe.

## Content extension

All the templates are located at the root of your environment folder, in a folder called `_toolbox`.

Inside this folder, you can create as many folders as you want, and place any type of documents (`.jpg`, `.png`, `.pdf`, `ppt`...).

[See how to use template inside Compositeur Digital UX](../../user_guide/using_compositeur/actions.md#adding-notes-blanksheet-or-templates)

### Notes templates

If you want to add new templates for your Notes, inside your `_toolbox` folder, create a folder named `notes`. Inside this folder, you add images (`.jpeg`, `.jpg`, `.png`) which will behave like notes.

### Blanksheet templates

If you want to add new templates for your Blanksheets, inside your `_toolbox` folder, create a folder named `papers`. Inside this folder, you add images (`.jpeg`, `.jpg`, `.png`) which will behave like blanksheets.
