## A/V Codecs

A video file format can embed different coding/decoding standards. Those standards called “codecs” should be installed on your computer. K-Lite Codec Pack includes a wide variety of codecs. Please note that some uncommon codecs may not be supported within Compositeur Digital UX.

Our recommendation is to use WMV and MP4(H264) format for a safe use.
