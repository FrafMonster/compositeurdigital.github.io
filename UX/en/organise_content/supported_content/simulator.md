## Content extension

To use a mortgage simulator, add the extension `.simupret` at the end of the name of your folder.

## Create a mortgage simulator

1. In your environment folder, create a folder named `<Name of your mortgage simulator>.simupret` (e.g. `My simulator.simupret`).
1. (Optional) You can change the preview of the mortgage simulator. In your `.simupret` folder, put an image (`.jpg` or `.png`) named `_preview`. If you don't provide a `_preview`, the item will have a default preview (shown below).
