## Seqences : 360° view

This content type allows you to display a 360° view of any objects, using a sequence of pre-rendered images (e.g. buildings).

### Action within Compositeur Digital UX

* [X] Move forward and backward in the sequence of images using the slider.
* [X] Make a copy of your sequence using the `Duplicate` action.
* [X] Make a capture (i.e. create an image of current position in the sequence) using the `Capture` action.
* [X] Add the sequence to your favorite, using the `Add to favorites` action.
* [X] Remove the sequence from your favorites, using the `Remove from favorites` action.

### Content extension

To use a sequence, put all the images which are composing your sequence in a folder, and add the extension `.sequence` at the end of the name of your folder. Inside your sequence, only use files that end with `.jpeg`, `.jpg` or `.png`.

### Create a sequence

1. In your universer folder, create a folder named `<Name of your sequence>.sequence` (e.g. `My sequence.sequence`).
2. Drag and drop all the files which are composing your sequence in this folder.

### Layers

If you have multiple layers to display (the different floors of a building for example), you can organize your images folders for each layer, and put them in a global .sequence folder.

Here is an example :

* Building.sequence
  * Floor 1
    * 001.png
    * 002.png
...
  * Floor 2
    * 001.png
    * 002.png
...

Layers will be ordered by their names, from bottom to top, i.e. :

...
* Floor 2
* Floor 1
