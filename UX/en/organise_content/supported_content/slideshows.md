## Content extension 

To use a slideshow, put all the files you want in a folder, and add the extension `.slideshow` at the end of the name of your folder.
Only use images, PowerPoint presentations and PDF documents, or `.pptx`, or another `.slideshow` folder.

## Create a slideshow

1. In your environment folder, create a folder named `<Name of your slideshow>.slideshow` (e.g. `My slideshow.slideshow`).
2. Drag and drop all the PDF documents,  PowerPoint presentations and images you need.

> Note 1 : To make sure slides in your slideshow are ordered, you can number them from 0 to X. Numbers won't be displayed in Compositeur Digital UX (e.g. `0 - First level` will be `First level`).

> Note 2 : By default, the preview of the item will be the first file composing the slideshow. You can provide your own preview with a file named `_preview.jpg` or `_preview.png`.

**Important** : If your slideshow includes a powerpoint, and if this powerpoint has [Hot Spots](powerpoint.md#hot-spots), make sure the content linked from the powerpoint of your slideshow belongs to your slideshow directoty. Keep in mind that content can be put in a hidden folder, which will not appear in Compositeur Digital UX.
