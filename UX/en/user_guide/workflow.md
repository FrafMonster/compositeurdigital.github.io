## Beginning of your meeting

Your Compositeur Digital UX is started, waiting for a [universe to be opened](presentation.md#universes). 
Three situations are available here : 
1. Either you already have created a universe that contains all your important documents which will be useful during your meeting and you have never worked on this universe;
1. You have a universe, and you already have saved [projects](presentation.md#projects) out of it;
1. Or you just need an empty space to start talking about your meeting goals.

Depending on your situation, open your universe, project or start an empty workspace.

Your meeting can start now!

## During your meeting

During your presentation, you'll face some situations where you'll need to interact with the workspace. This section summarizes all the actions you can do.

### Open your document

During your presentation, you'll probably need to work on documents. If your universe includes documents, you can [open a document](presentation.md#open-a-document) using the dock area:

1. If the dock is not visible, tap on the navigation bar at the bottom of the screen. 
1. If your document is already on screen, it will arrive under your finger.

If your dock is empty, make sure the dock is displaying your universe documents:

![Workflow open universe](../img/workflow_open_universe.jpg)

1. Tap on the main menu button.
1. Tap on the button which contains your universe's name.
1. All the documents which belong to your universe are now displayed in the dock.

### Annotate your document

The workspace allows you to annotate a document, it requires to have a pencil recognized by your device. Simply use the pencil on your document. You can change the color of the ink, and the type of the ink as well.

![Workflow annotate](../img/workflow_annotate1.JPG) ![Workflow annotate](../img/workflow_annotate2.JPG)

1. Tap on the action button of your document.
1. Tap on `Ink`.
1. Select the color and the ink type you want.

> Note : Your pencil device should have an "eraser" that you can use to erase the ink strokes you have been writing.

### Use blanksheets and notes

Do you need empty papers to ideate? No problem, we have that for you!

Compositeur Digital UX lets you work with blank documents and notes to stimulates your ideation process.
To add one of these documents to your project:

![Workflow add blanksheets and notes](../img/workflow_add_blanksheets_notes.jpg)

1. Tap on the main button menu.
1. Browse the documents area to select the type of document you want to add.
1. Drag and drop the document in the workspace, or just tap on it.

Notes can be sticked on any document, just like post-it in real life!

Blanksheets can also be sticked on documents, using the tape.

### Use templates 

Templates can be very useful, depending on your meeting type (todo list, models, ect...). Compositeur Digital UX supports [template edition and creation](../organise_content/supported_content/templates.md)

To add a template to your workspace:

![Workflow add blanksheets and notes](../img/workflow_add_blanksheets_notes.jpg)

1. Tap on the main button menu.
1. Browse the documents area to select the template you want to add.
1. Drag and drop the template in the workspace, or just tap on it.

### Structure your workspace with a corkboard

A corkboard is very useful to structure your workspace. The documents attached to the corkboard cannot be manipulated until they are detached from the corkboard. You're free to manipulate the corkboard. To move it, to resize it, ect.

![Workspace corkboard](../img/workflow_corkboard.jpg)

To add a corkboard to your workspace:
1. Tap on the main button menu.
1. Browse the documents area to select a type of corkboard.

### Create a copy of your document

At some point, you might need to compare several versions of the same file. To do it, just make a copy of your document using the `Duplicate` action.
Using your pencil, you can [annotate your document](#annotate-your-document) and write the version number (e.g. "V1", "V2", ect...).

> Note : When your document is duplicated, all the annotations and documents pasted on it are duplicated too.

### Create a capture of your document

You can create a capture of a document to add annotations on it. For example, videos do not support annotations. If you want to edit a frame of the video, you can make a capture of the frame. 
Use the action menu of your item, and tap on `Capture`.
