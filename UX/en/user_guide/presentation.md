## Vocabulary 

* **Universe** : a universe is a windows folder which contains a set of documents, images, video, 3D models which will be used during your working session. During your work through the workspace, changes to these files can be saved in different projects.
* **Projects** : a project contains all the work you have achieved in a universe : annotations, documents opened and manipulated, ect. Each project is attached to a universe.
* **Workspace** : the workspace allows you to open, visualize and manipulate various types of documents : images, pdf, powerpoints, video, ect... Using pencil, you can write annotations on your documents.
* **Source** : a source contains a set of universes. Three types of source exist :
   * *A local source* : it is a folder on your computer (e.g. the default source uses the path `<HD>\<user>\Documents\Compositeur Digital UX`. This folder contains universes which are saved on your computer.
   * *USB Key sources* : it is a folder on a USB key (e.g. `<KEY>\Compositeur Digital UX`). When you use USB keys, you can start a project on a device, save your project on your key, and then continue to work on your project using another device.
   * *Cloud sources* : it is Microsoft Teams channel or a SharePoint site of your organisation. You need an internet access and an Office365 tenant to use cloud sources.
