# What is a project

When starting Compositeur Digital UX, and opening an environment, a project is created immediately. A project allows you to work on an environment, and to save all the work that you'll do on the environment's documents (annotations, opened documents, ect...)

The environment is never modified directly. It means that you can start as many project as you want from an environment, without modifying its structure and the documents it is composed of. 

When they are saved, the projects will stay attached to the environment they have been started from. It means that, if you're working from an environment stored on a USB stick, the projects you will make will stay on the USB stick, and you will be able to open those projects from another device running Compositeur Digital UX, by pluggin in your USB stick.

**Important** : 
* If you modify an environment that have projects attached to it, keep in mind that if you remove a document from this environment, the document will be removed from all the projects.
* In a similar way, if you add new documents to this environment, the document will be accessible from all your projects.
* Imported documents are related to projects, not environment. It means that a document you have imported in a project will not appear in another project, even if they are based on the same environment.
