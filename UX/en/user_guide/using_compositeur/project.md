## What is a project

When starting Compositeur Digital UX, and opening a universe, a project is created immediately. A project allows you to work on a universe, and to save all the work that you'll do on the universe's documents (annotations, opened documents, ect...)

The universe is never modified directly. It means that you can start as many project as you want from a universe, without modifying its structure and the documents it is composed of. 

When they are saved, the projects will stay attached to the universe they have been started from. It means that, if you're working from a universe stored on a USB stick, the projects you will make will stay on the USB stick, and you will be able to open those projects from another device running Compositeur Digital UX, by pluggin in your USB stick.

**Important** : 
* If you modify a universe that have projects attached to it, keep in mind that if you remove a document from this universe, the document will be removed from all the projects.
* In a similar way, if you add new documents to this universe, the document will be accessible from all your projects.
* Imported documents are related to projects, not universe. It means that a document you have imported in a project will not appear in another project, even if they are based on the same universe.
