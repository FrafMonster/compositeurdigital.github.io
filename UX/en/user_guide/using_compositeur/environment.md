# Environments

An environment contains all the documents you need for a specific meeting or presentation. These documents can be different, e.g. pdfs, powerpoints, images, video... They can be placed, and structured in various folders, to retrieve them easily from Compositeur Digital UX. 

A environment also contains graphical documents which will help you customizing how Compositeur Digital UX renders your environment: 
* A _background_ image, which can show your brand, or project related information.
* _Previews_ for your documents and folders, to make them look nice in the dock area.

Basically, from a Microsoft-Windows perspective, an environment is just a folder, that contains sub-folders and files. Compositeur Digital UX offers you a way to render these folders differently by creating deeper interaction.
